		<h3>grab2web 1.0</h3>
		
		<h3>What is grab2web?</h3>
		<p>This program is a small tool to grab images from a video source and put it into the web. grab2web runs in the background
			and can be reconfigured via a small icon in the system tray.</p>
		
		<h3>Requirements</h3>
		<p>To use grab2web your computer has to fulfill the following requirements:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>DirectX 9b has to be installed</li>
			<li>A video source with WDM driver has to be connected to your computer (e.g. a webcam or a Frame Grabber-Card)</li>
			<li>You need to have a ftp account on your webserver to upload the images</li>
			<li>A graphic card with overlay</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Automization</h3>
		<p>grab2web can be run in the background. Therefore all necessary data has to be inserted once into the gui. This data
			including the ftp password will be stored unencrypted into the windows registry.<br>
			Once the program has stored this data you can open the program using these parameters:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>-h<br>
			    grab2web will be started minimized</li>
			<li>-r<br>
					Image grabbing will be started automatically</li>
			<li>-c&lt;Folder&gt;<br>
			    Now the program stores a copy of each picture in the folder "&lt;Folder&gt;". When the path contains spaces
					you'll need to put the path in quotation marks ("-cC:\Data\My Pictures\Webcam").</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>grab2web uses the jpeg image format to store images. During the capture procedure images are stored as windows bitmaps 
			internally. Due to the fact that the windows bitmap format can not hold more than 24 bit of color data you should select a 
			video format with no more than 24 bit of color data. Otherwise your images may be completely white or black.
		</p>
